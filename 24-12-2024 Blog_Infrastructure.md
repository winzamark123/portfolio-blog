# Blog Infrastructure
This idea of a blog started when I stumbled upon [Network Chuck's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnE7c0ELEH8&ab_channel=NetworkChuck). It was a start to finish on how he set up a blog site using **obsidian**, **HUGO**, and **HOSTINGER**. 

Inspired by this I tried setting up my own. 

### Main Differences 
The main difference I had with Chuck's video and many other **"setting up obsidian blog tutorials"** was that I had a website already set up and deployed. There wasn't any 3rd party APIs or plugins that I can just pluck into my code base since it involved multiple steps including some which were specific to me. 

Although this COULD be a potential SAAS product :3 
### Key Features 
- Integrate into my current running portfolio website
- Customisable themes and aestethics (fonts, headings, padding, etc)
- Contains images and drawings

### Infrastructure

### Workflow 
With the infrastructure set up, the workflow for writing a blog becomes seamless. Most of which is handled by the Devops which I've set up in the pipeline. 

1. Create a new file under the Blog 
2. Specify the title, date, and tags
3. Write content
4. Push and sync on Obsidian
