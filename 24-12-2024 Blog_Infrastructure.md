# Blog Infrastructure
This idea of a blog started when I stumbled upon [Network Chuck's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnE7c0ELEH8&ab_channel=NetworkChuck). It was a start to finish on how he set up a blog site using **obsidian**, **HUGO**, and **HOSTINGER**. 

Inspired by this I tried setting up my own. 

### Main Differences 
The main difference I had with Chuck's video and many other **"setting up obsidian blog tutorials"** was that I had a website already set up and deployed. There wasn't any 3rd party APIs or plugins that I can just pluck into my code base since it involved multiple steps including some which were specific to me. 

Although this COULD be a potential SAAS product :3
